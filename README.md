sokobangamepy.py was originally a copy and paste of a snake game made in pygame, found on youtube (we are learning how to use pygame for first time, so we first understood the code for the snake game first and then changed it bit by bit til it was sokoban), generic comments left are from that, not chatgpt copy and paste slop

TODO: Elevate complexity of the game state (add more than one block and hole) and have the agent learn effectively

RECENT COMMIT TOT REWARD VS GAME NUMBER: (result of adding more negative rewards to avoid redundant moves)
